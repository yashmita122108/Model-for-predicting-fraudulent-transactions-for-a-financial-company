# Model-for-predicting-fraudulent-transactions-for-a-financial-company

Fraud detection model in elaboration The fraud detection model was constructed by first exploring the dataset to understand its characteristics. Feature selection was based on a combination of domain knowledge, data exploration, and statistical techniques like feature importance from tree-based models. Variables that showed significant correlations with fraudulent transactions and were relevant to the financial context were included.

Variables to be included in the model To demonstrate the model's performance, we employed a range of tools and techniques such as ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices. Additionally, we utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions. Cross-validation and hold-out testing were also performed to ensure robustness.

key factors that predict fraudulent customer Key factors predicting fraudulent customers were identified through feature analysis and model interpretation techniques. These factors often included transaction frequency, transaction amount, location of transactions, and unusual transaction patterns.
